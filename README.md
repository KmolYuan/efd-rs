# efd

This crate implements Elliptical Fourier Descriptor (EFD) curve fitting
by using `ndarray` to handle the 2D arrays.

Reference: Kuhl, FP and Giardina, CR (1982). Elliptic Fourier features of
a closed contour. Computer graphics and image processing, 18(3), 236-258.

This is an unofficial implementation.
